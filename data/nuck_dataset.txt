NuckAi is an exciting new artificial intelligence project. Its goal is to create a multimodal model that can run efficiently on mobile devices. The core of NuckAi begins with a small language model, trained on a diverse range of text. This foundation is crucial for later expansion into more complex tasks like vision and language fusion. We are building it from the ground up, using Python and PyTorch, and then scaling it with Swift and CoreML.
